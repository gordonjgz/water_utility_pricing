## 📄 Abstract

> Climate change is increasing the variance of weather patterns, leading to greater demand variability and, consequently, more unstable revenue for utility companies.  
> The utility’s pre-set fixed Increasing Block Pricing (IBP) must recover costs while also fulfilling policy goals related to conservation and equity—challenges that are amplified by growing weather variability.  
> This paper evaluates how changes in weather variance affect the utility’s Ramsey pricing problem.  
> Using a rich panel of monthly household water utility transaction data from Austin, TX, spanning 2018–2019, I estimate demand elasticity with a structural discrete-continuous choice (DCC) model that accounts for nonlinear budget constraints.  
> In the counterfactual analysis, I solve the optimal Ramsey pricing problem under different levels of precipitation variance.  
> The results show that when precipitation variance is high, adding concavity to the utility’s revenue preference increases the progressive distributional effect, as risk aversion leads the utility to discount the revenue contribution of higher-income consumers to meet the conservation constraint.  
> In contrast, when precipitation variance is low, introducing concavity makes the distributional effect more regressive.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies my dissertation research on the intersection of utility pricing, climate variability, and economic welfare. It includes:

- A structural DCC model of household water demand
- Counterfactual simulations of Ramsey pricing under different precipitation variances
- Distributional and revenue tradeoff analysis under risk-averse utility preferences
