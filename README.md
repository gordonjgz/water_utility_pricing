## 📄 Abstract

> Many economic research studies have been focusing on the demand and welfare estimation of the ride-hailing market, specifically for platforms like Uber and Lyft.
> In this paper, I estimate the welfare effect of UberPool as a new product in the ride-hailing market, accounting for heterogeneous preferences within and across locations by using a discrete-type random coefficient nested logit model.
> I find that, relative to the counterfactual worlds without UberPool, UberPool can increase consumer surplus by 31.58% - 33.51%.
> Even a partially accessible UberPool by location is 2.57% higher on consumer surplus, compared to if only UberX were provided but with lower prices, which shows the magnitude of the variety effect in the ride-hailing market.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies my research on the variety effect of UberPool. It includes:

- A discrete-type random coefficient nested logit model to estimate the demand (also known as BCS)
- Counterfactual simulations of removing UberPool
