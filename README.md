## ðŸ“„ Abstract

> Climate change is increasing the variance of weather patterns, leading to greater demand variability and, consequently, more unstable revenue for utility companies.  
> The utilityâ€™s pre-set fixed Increasing Block Pricing (IBP) must recover costs while also fulfilling policy goals related to conservation and equityâ€”challenges that are amplified by growing weather variability.  
> This paper evaluates how changes in weather variance affect the utilityâ€™s Ramsey pricing problem.  
> Using a rich panel of monthly household water utility transaction data from Austin, TX, spanning 2018â€“2019, I estimate demand elasticity with a structural discrete-continuous choice (DCC) model that accounts for nonlinear budget constraints.  
> In the counterfactual analysis, I solve the optimal Ramsey pricing problem under different levels of precipitation variance.  
> The results show that when precipitation variance is high, adding concavity to the utilityâ€™s revenue preference increases the progressive distributional effect, as risk aversion leads the utility to discount the revenue contribution of higher-income consumers to meet the conservation constraint.  
> In contrast, when precipitation variance is low, introducing concavity makes the distributional effect more regressive.
