## 📄 Abstract

> As climate change amplifies extreme weather conditions, water utilities face increasingly volatile demand and revenue, challenging the ability of fixed Increasing Block Prices (IBP) to simultaneously ensure revenue feasibility, promote conservation, and protect low-income consumers.
> This paper tests whether price alone can achieve these competing policy goals under such conditions.
> Using granular household data from Austin, TX, and a structural demand model enhanced with satellite imagery-derived vegetation index, I find that the presence of high-quantity consumers across all income levels undermines the effectiveness of IBP.
> Furthermore, higher-income households—who are both weather-sensitive and surprisingly price-elastic—complicate the utility's ability to achieve its distributional objectives while meeting conservation and revenue targets.
> Empirically, when extreme weather shifts the demand curve rightward (e.g., during a drought), the conservation constraint becomes binding, imposing a disproportionate welfare loss on the lowest-income stratum, averaging \$60.92 per household per month.
> Conversely, when demand shifts leftward (e.g., during rainy periods), revenue concerns become binding, also imposing a disproportionate loss on the same group, averaging \$63.65 per household per month.
> These results highlight the necessity of complementary policies to achieve distributional goals. For example, encouraging households to zeroscaping/xeriscaping by 20\% could generate \$57.35 in welfare per household per month for the lowest-income stratum, almost nullifying the welfare loss from the conservation policy’s shadow cost.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies my dissertation research on the intersection of utility pricing, climate variability, and economic welfare. It includes:

- A structural DCC model of household water demand
- Counterfactual simulations of Ramsey pricing under different precipitation variances
- Distributional and revenue tradeoff analysis under risk-averse utility preferences
