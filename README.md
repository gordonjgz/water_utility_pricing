## 📄 Abstract

> As climate change amplifies more volatile weather patterns, water utilities face increasing difficulty in simultaneously ensuring revenue feasibility, promoting water conservation, and protecting low-income consumers.
> This paper tests and concludes that price alone cannot achieve these competing policy goals under different weather patterns.
> Using granular household data from Austin, TX, and a structural demand model enhanced with satellite imagery-derived vegetation index, I find that because high-water users exist across all income levels, traditional tiered pricing doesn’t work as intended.
> Furthermore, higher-income households—who are both weather-sensitive and surprisingly price-elastic—complicate the utility's ability to achieve its distributional objectives while meeting the conservation target.
> When high-demand conditions (e.g., drought) make conservation measures necessary, low-income families experience an average welfare loss of \$74 per month.
> This highlights the necessity of complementary policies to achieve distributional goals when demand increases.
> For example, a program encouraging households to convert 30\% of their lawns to water-saving landscapes (zeroscaping/xeriscaping) could generate approximately \$70 per month in welfare for the lowest-income families, nearly offsetting the financial burden imposed by conservation policies during droughts.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies my dissertation research on the intersection of utility pricing, climate variability, and economic welfare. It includes:

- A structural DCC model of household water demand
- Counterfactual simulations of Ramsey pricing under different weather conditions
- Estimation of the shadow cost of policy constraint under counterfactual weather conditions, especially for the lowest income stratum
- The welfare benefit from the additional policies like Zeroscaping towards the lowest income stratum
