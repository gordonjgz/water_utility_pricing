## 📄 Abstract

> As climate change amplifies extreme weather, water utilities face increasing difficulty in simultaneously ensuring revenue feasibility, promoting water conservation, and protecting low-income consumers.
> This paper tests and concludes that price alone cannot achieve these competing policy goals under extreme weather.
> Using granular household data from Austin, TX, and a structural demand model enhanced with satellite imagery-derived vegetation index, I find that because high-water users exist across all income levels, traditional tiered pricing doesn’t work as intended.
> Furthermore, higher-income households—who are both weather-sensitive and surprisingly price-elastic—complicate the utility's ability to achieve its distributional objectives while meeting conservation and revenue targets.
> When high-demand conditions (e.g., drought) make conservation measures necessary, low-income families experience an average welfare loss of $61 per month. Conversely, when low-demand conditions lead to revenue shortfalls for the utility, the resulting rate adjustments also impose a significant loss on this same group, averaging $64 per month.
> These results highlight the necessity of complementary policies to achieve distributional goals.
> For example, a program encouraging households to convert 20% of their lawns to water-saving landscapes (zeroscaping/xeriscaping) could generate approximately $57 per month in welfare for the lowest-income families, nearly offsetting the financial burden imposed by conservation policies during droughts.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies my dissertation research on the intersection of utility pricing, climate variability, and economic welfare. It includes:

- A structural DCC model of household water demand
- Counterfactual simulations of Ramsey pricing under different weather conditions
- Estimation of the shadow cost of policy constraint under counterfactual weather conditions, especially for the lowest income stratum
- The welfare benefit from the additional policies like Zeroscaping towards the lowest income stratum
